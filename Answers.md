1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.Server side routing occurs when you click on a link, it makes a request to a server, and then serves a new document to the user. Client-side routing occurs when a route is handled internally by the page. The whole page won't refresh when using client-side routing, just some element or component of it.

With server-side routing the only data that's loaded is what is requested, whereas with client-side routing the whole website or application is loaded on the first request.

With server-side routing the whole page is refreshed every time a request is made which could be slow and/or unnecessary. With client-side routing, after first load, transitions/animations/navigating to different parts of the website/application are generally much faster.
